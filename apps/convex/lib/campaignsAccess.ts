/**
 * Access gate for the email-campaigns surface (`audiences.ts`, `campaigns.ts`).
 *
 * DESK VISIBILITY (`hasCampaignsAccess`/`requireCampaignsAccess`) — superuser,
 * OR a central Executive Director / Financial Manager
 * (`lib/finance.ts#isCentralEdOrFm`, the legacy title-based path, kept for
 * backward compat), OR a person holding a CENTRAL seat carrying
 * `campaigns.compose` or `campaigns.approve` (today: `executive_director`,
 * `financial_manager`, `marketing_director` — see `SEAT_DEFS`). Widened from
 * "ED/FM only" by the founder's two-party campaign-approval requirement
 * (2026-07-24), which named the Marketing Director as a valid approver
 * alongside the ED/FM — that only works if a Marketing Director's seat can
 * open the desk in the first place.
 *
 * APPROVAL POWER (`hasCampaignApprovalPower`/`requireCampaignApprovalPower`)
 * is DELIBERATELY seat-capability-only (no legacy-title fallback) — unlike
 * desk visibility, this is a BRAND NEW power this PR introduces, so there's
 * no pre-existing title-based behavior to stay backward compatible with; it
 * exists purely so it can be granted/revoked per-seat at runtime
 * (`seats.ts#setSeatCampaignPower`), exactly like the giving desk's
 * view/manage power (`lib/givingAccess.ts`'s doc).
 *
 * The caller's people rows are resolved the SAME union-across-every-
 * non-placeholder-`people`-row-for-the-userId way `lib/givingAccess.ts`
 * (:54-99) does, rather than `lib/finance.ts#resolveCallerPersonId`'s
 * single-chapter lookup — campaigns is CENTRAL-only and has no
 * chapter/scope context of its own to anchor a single roster row against.
