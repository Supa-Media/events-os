/**
 * Org chart (seats) — read queries.
 *
 * The chart is deliberately ORG-TRANSPARENT: any signed-in member may read
 * it, including the FULL cross-chapter tree (every chapter's seat occupancy
 * at once) — this is an explicit OWNER PRODUCT DECISION (2026-07-16): the Org
 * Chart is a tab visible to everybody, org-transparent by design, unlike the
 * finance surfaces (which DO scope reads to the caller's own
 * chapter/central reach). All three reads below (`chart`, `seatDetail`,
 * `mySeatAssignments`) are gated only by `requireAccess` — no chapter- or
 * central-scoping check beyond that. (A follow-up nuance — guest-allowlisted
 * accounts sitting at the same trust tier as domain members for this read —
 * has been raised with the owner separately; no code change pending that.)
 * This PR is schema + seed + reads only — no assignment mutations (a later
 * PR) and no capability enforcement changes.
 *
 * The chapter chart is defined ONCE and shared by every chapter (same
 * shape/duties/capabilities everywhere) — only OCCUPANCY (`seatAssignments`)
 * is per-chapter. The central chart's `chapter_directors` seat is `derived`:
 * its "holders" are computed by rolling up every chapter's `chapter_director`
 * (the chapter chart's root seat), never assigned directly.
