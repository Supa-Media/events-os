/**
 * Territories (giving-territories addendum — supersedes `cityCampaigns`, PRD
 * B6). A territory is a place Public Worship is raising toward or already
 * running: "Queens", "Columbus, OH". Unlike the retired `cityCampaigns` model,
 * a territory maps **1:1 with a real `chapters` row** — creating a prospect
 * territory CREATES a "shadow chapter" (`isActive: false`) in the same
 * mutation (see `territories.saveTerritory`). Prospect pledges/donors/gifts
 * therefore scope DIRECTLY to that shadow chapter; the old "central +
 * cityCampaignId" convention is gone, and launch is a flag-flip
 * (`chapters.isActive: true`) rather than a re-scope. See
 * `docs/plans/giving-territories.md`.
 *
 * There is NO `backerCount` here — a territory's backer count is ALWAYS read
 * from its linked chapter's own `chapters.backerCount` (derived by
 * `givingPledges.recomputeChapterBackerCount`), so there is only ever one
 * counter per place and it can never drift.
 */

/**
 * A territory's lifecycle:
 *  - `prospect` — just added by central/dev-director; its shadow chapter is
 *                 inactive. Shows on the map if `publiclyVisible`.
 *  - `raising`  — actively promoted, collecting backers (chapter still
 *                 inactive).
 *  - `launched` — the chapter went live (`isActive: true`); banking is
 *                 provisioned. TERMINAL in v1 — reverse transitions are
 *                 rejected.
